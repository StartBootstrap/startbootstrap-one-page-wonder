## Usage

### Run Locally 

Run `yarn install` and then run `yarn run start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### Gulp Tasks

* `gulp` the default task that builds everything
* `gulp watch` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
* `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
* `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
